#
# # If it isn't possible to find out the correct mail domain name of
# # your system in /etc/mailname, by reading sendmail.cf, /etc/hostname
# # or /etc/HOSTNAME, you can specify it in the variable
# # MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME. This overrides all other mechanisms.
# #
# MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME=linsec.ca
#
# # - m_muttalias      query set of mutt alias files:
# #
# # Set MUTTALIAS_FILES below to list of files in MUTT_DIRECTORY that
# # contain mutt aliases. File names without leading slash will have
# # $MUTT_DIRECTORY (defaults to $HOME/.mutt or $HOME, if ~/.mutt does
# # not exist) prepended before the file name. Absolute file names
# # (beginning with /) will be taken direct.
# #
# MUTT_DIRECTORY="$HOME/.mutt"
# MUTTALIAS_FILES="aliases"
#
#
# # If you want to use private modules set the MODULES_PATH to find them:
# # (a space separated list):
# #
# MODULES_PATH="/sw/lib/lbdb"
#
#
# #
# # Do you want the output to be sorted?
# # If you set this to "false" or "no", lbdbq won't sort the addresses
# # but returns them in reverse order (which means that the most recent
# # address in m_inmail database is first).
# # If you set this to "name", lbdbq sorts the output by real name.
# # If you set this to "comment", lbdbq sorts the output by comment (column 3).
# # If you set this to "address", lbdbq sorts the output by addresses
# # (that's the default).
# #
# SORT_OUTPUT=name
#
# #
# # Do you want to see duplicate mail addresses (with multiple real
# # names or different comment fields)?  Default is "no".
# #
# #KEEP_DUPES=no
