# Create Plan

## Goal

Turn a user prompt into a **single, actionable plan** delivered in the final assistant message.

## Minimal workflow

Throughout the entire workflow, operate in read-only mode. Do not write or update files.

1. **Scan context quickly**
   - Read `README.md` and any obvious docs (`docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
   - Skim relevant files (the ones most likely touched).
   - Identify constraints (language, frameworks, CI/test commands, deployment shape).

2. **Ask follow-ups**
   - Use the `ask-questions-if-underspecified` skill.

3. **Create a plan using the template below**
   - Start with **1 short paragraph** describing the intent and approach.
   - Clearly call out what is **in scope** and what is **not in scope** in short.
   - Then provide a **small checklist** of action items (default 6–10 items).
      - Each checklist item should be a concrete action and, when helpful, mention files/commands.
      - **Make items atomic and ordered**: discovery → changes → tests → rollout.
      - **Verb-first**: "Add…", "Refactor…", "Verify…", "Ship…".
   - Include at least one item for **tests/validation** and one for **edge cases/risk** when applicable.
   - If there are unknowns, include a tiny **Open questions** section (max 3).

4. **Do not preface the plan with meta explanations; output only the plan as per template**

## Plan template (follow exactly)

```markdown
# Plan

<1–3 sentences: what we're doing, why, and the high-level approach.>

## Scope
- In:
- Out:

## Action items
[ ] <Step 1>
[ ] <Step 2>
[ ] <Step 3>
[ ] <Step 4>
[ ] <Step 5>
[ ] <Step 6>

## Open questions
- <Question 1>
- <Question 2>
- <Question 3>
```

## Checklist item guidance
Good checklist items:
- Point to likely files/modules: src/..., app/..., services/...
- Name concrete validation: "Run npm test", "Add unit tests for X"
- Include safe rollout when relevant: feature flag, migration plan, rollback note

Avoid:
- Vague steps ("handle backend", "do auth")
- Too many micro-steps
- Writing code snippets (keep the plan implementation-agnostic)
